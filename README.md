# AI-Driven Snake Game with Reinforcement Learning

## Introduction
In this project, we've developed an AI that learns to play the classic Snake game. The project is built from scratch using Python, with Pygame for game development and PyTorch for implementing reinforcement learning algorithms. The AI is trained using Deep Q Learning, a popular method in reinforcement learning.

## Features
- A fully playable Snake game implemented with Pygame.
- A reinforcement learning agent trained using Deep Q Learning.
- Integration of PyTorch for building and training the neural network.

## Project Structure
- `Part 1`: Introduction to the project, basics of Reinforcement Learning and Deep Q Learning.
- `Part 2`: Setting up the environment and implementing the Snake game with Pygame.
- `Part 3`: Implementation of the reinforcement learning agent.
- `Part 4`: Building and training the neural network with PyTorch to predict the moves of the snake.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- PyTorch

## How It Works
The AI agent uses a neural network to make decisions based on the state of the game. The agent is trained using Deep Q Learning, which helps it to learn the optimal strategy for playing Snake.
